# Unusual PnL when closing a position detection bot

## Description

This bot detects unusual `realisedPnL` based on the account's profit ratio, relative to both the `collateral` and `leverage`, when closing the position.

> The threshold `unUsualLimit` and `highPnlToSize` of what is considered unusual and high pnl to size respectively, can be adjusted for each network in **src/network.ts**.

## Supported Chains

- Arbitrum
- Avalanche

## Alerts

- GMX-6

  - Fired when a `ClosePosition` event is emitted with a `realisedPnL` that exceeds the threshold `UNUSUAL_LIMIT` and the `realisedPnL` divided by the position `size` exceeds the threshold `HIGH_PNLTOSIZE`.
  - Severity is always set to "Info".
  - Type is always set to "Info".
  - Metadata contains:
    - `GMX`: The address of GMX Vault contract.
    - `Realised PnL`: The realisedPnl of the closed position.
    - `Position size`: The size of the closed position.
    - `Position key`: The key of the closed position.

## Test Data

The bot behaviour can be verified with the following transaction:

- [0x72fe407b5c417f2e7f61aeaf471d61c8922f2ca3135367e99914657929d8ef4d](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x72fe407b5c417f2e7f61aeaf471d61c8922f2ca3135367e99914657929d8ef4d)

  > `unUsualLimit` should be set to <= 33000 for this test transaction.
  > `highPnlToSize` should be set to <= 1.1 for this test transaction.
