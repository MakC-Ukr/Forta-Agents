# Closing/Decreasing large size position detection bot

## Description

This bot detects the closing of a position or decrease in an existing position in GMX vault when the
`sizeDelta` is considered large.

> The threshold `largeLimit` of what is considered large for each network can be adjusted in `NetworkData` in **src/network.ts**.
