# Large LP Token Deposit/Withdraw Bot

## Description

This bot detects large LP Token Deposit/Withdraw on Pancakeswap.

The bot can operate in two different modes, used to determine the threshold of a large deposit/withdrawal amount.

- `STATIC` mode refers to the bot using a static predefined threshold in number of tokens.
- `PERCENTAGE` mode refers to setting the threshold as a percentage of the total balance of tokens in the LP pool.

In order to switch between the two modes, change `DYNAMIC_CONFIG` to `STATIC_CONFIG` in agent.ts, L54.
